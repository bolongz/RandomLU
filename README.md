#Main Code for the paper: 

Zhang, Bolong, and Michael Mascagni. "Pass-Efficient Randomized LU Algorithms for Computing Low-Rank Matrix Approximation." arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.07138 (2020).


RandQB Algorithms implentation are from: https://github.com/WenjianYu/randQB_auto. RandQB algorithms are used to test. 

Traditional Randomized LU Implentations are from: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/60975-randomized-lu-decomposition. We build some of our code from this.
